# ScreenInfo
Android screen info tool for developers.

Heavily inspired by very useful, but unfortunately no longer supported app [CB Screen Resolution][1].

This application:
- displays screen resolution (width and height) in DPI (Device Independent Pixels) and physical pixels,
- displays size, density, orientation and aspect ratio screen characteristics (see [Supporting Multiple Screens][2]),
- show/hide status bar and navigation bar by clicking to screen field,
- show/hide action bar,
- reacts to orientation changes.
